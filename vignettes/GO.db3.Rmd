# Introduction

This package aims to replace GO.db.  The AnnotationPipeline system in which
GO.db is constructed has become stale.

# Demonstration

```{r lk,message=FALSE}
library(GO.db3)
GO.db
select(GO.db, keys=c("GO:0009435", "GO:0009436"), keytype="GOID", columns=c("GOID", "TERM", "ONTOLOGY"))
```

The mapIds method needs to be implemented.
